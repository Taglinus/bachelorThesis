	abstract = {Activating transcription factor 4 ({ATF}4) belongs to the activating transcription factor family and its expression is increased upon the stimulation of a diverse array of microenvironmental stresses. {ATF}4 plays a major role in the development, metabolism, and memory formation. Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease in aged population. The dominant pathological changes in {AD} brain, including the neurofibrillary tangles, consist of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, senile plaques composed of β-amyloid proteins, loss of neurons in the whole brain, and dysfunction of synapses. The protein level of {ATF}4 is upregulated in both {AD} brain and {AD} mouse model, indicating its latent roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. In this paper, we reviewed the related literatures about the interaction of {ATF}4 with the different types of pathological changes in {AD} brain and pointed out some unsolved problems in this area. We also proposed that a fine regulation of {ATF}4 in separate neurons or brain regions might be benefit to the therapy of {AD}.},

Here we report a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism that silences the cellular response to mitochondrial protein import stress. Crucial to this process is the silencing factor of the integrated stress response ({SIFI}), a large E3 ligase complex mutated in ataxia and in early-onset dementia that degrades both unimported mitochondrial precursors and stress response components. By recognizing bifunctional substrate motifs that equally encode protein localization and stability, the {SIFI} complex turns off a general stress response after a specific stress event has been resolved. Pharmacological stress response silencing sustains cell survival even if stress resolution failed, which underscores the importance of signal termination and provides a roadmap for treating neurodegenerative diseases caused by mitochondrial import defects.},

              Designing {PCR} primers for amplifying regions of eukaryotic genomes is a complicated task because the genomes contain a large number of repeat sequences and other regions unsuitable for amplification by {PCR}. We have developed a novel k-mer based masking method that uses a statistical model to detect and mask failure-prone regions on the {DNA} template prior to primer design. We implemented the software as a standalone software primer3\_masker and integrated it into the primer design program Primer3.

            Summary: The determination of annealing temperature is a critical step in {PCR} design. This parameter is typically derived from the melting temperature of the {PCR} primers, so for successful {PCR} work it is important to determine the melting temperature of primer accurately. We introduced several enhancements in the widely used primer design program Primer3. The improvements include a formula for calculating melting temperature and a salt correction formula. Also, the new version can take into account the effects of divalent cations, which are included in most {PCR} buffers. Another modification enables using lowercase masked template sequences for primer design.
            Availability: Features described in this article have been implemented into the development code of Primer3 and will be available in future versions (version 1.1 and newer) of Primer3. Also, a modified version is compiled under the name of {mPrimer}3 which is distributed independently. The web-based version of {mPrimer}3 is available at http://bioinfo.ebc.ee/mprimer3/ and the binary code is freely downloadable from the {URL} http://bioinfo.ebc.ee/download/.

	abstract = {Polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) is a basic molecular biology technique with a multiplicity of uses, including deoxyribonucleic acid cloning and sequencing, functional analysis of genes, diagnosis of diseases, genotyping and discovery of genetic variants. Reliable primer design is crucial for successful {PCR}, and for over a decade, the open-source Primer3 software has been widely used for primer design, often in high-throughput genomics applications. It has also been incorporated into numerous publicly available software packages and web services. During this period, we have greatly expanded Primer3's functionality. In this article, we describe Primer3's current capabilities, emphasizing recent improvements. The most notable enhancements incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer design process, both to improve melting temperature prediction and to reduce the likelihood that primers will form hairpins or dimers. Additional enhancements include more precise control of primer placement-a change motivated partly by opportunities to use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair. We have made the core code more modular and provided cleaner programming interfaces to further ease integration with other software. These improvements position Primer3 for continued use with genome-scale data in the decade ahead.},

	abstract = {{HSF}1 (heat shock factor 1) is an evolutionarily conserved master transcriptional regulator of the heat shock response ({HSR}) in eukaryotic cells. In response to high temperatures, {HSF}1 upregulates genes encoding molecular chaperones, also called heat shock proteins, which assist the refolding or degradation of damaged intracellular proteins. Accumulating evidence reveals however that {HSF}1 participates in several other physiological and pathological processes such as differentiation, immune response, and multidrug resistance, as well as in ageing, neurodegenerative demise, and cancer. To address how {HSF}1 controls these processes one should systematically analyze its target genes. Here we present a novel database called {HSF}1Base (hsf1base.org) that contains a nearly comprehensive list of {HSF}1 target genes identified so far. The list was obtained by manually curating publications on individual {HSF}1 targets and analyzing relevant high throughput transcriptomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation data derived from the literature and the Yeastract database. To support the biological relevance of {HSF}1 targets identified by high throughput methods, we performed an enrichment analysis of (potential) {HSF}1 targets across different tissues/cell types and organisms. We found that general {HSF}1 functions (targets are expressed in all tissues/cell types) are mostly related to cellular proteostasis. Furthermore, {HSF}1 targets that are conserved across various animal taxa operate mostly in cellular stress pathways (e.g., autophagy), chromatin remodeling, ribosome biogenesis, and ageing. Together, these data highlight diverse roles for {HSF}1, expanding far beyond the {HSR}.},

A universal donor {DNA}, optionally provided as minicircle {DNA}, is cleaved simultaneously to be integrated at the genomic {DSB}, while processing the donor plasmid at three possible positions allows flexible reading-frame selection. Applying this system allows to create C-terminal tag fusions of endogenously encoded proteins in human cells with high efficiencies. Knocking out known {DSB} repair components reveals that site-specific insertion is completely dependent on canonical {NHEJ} ({DNA}-{PKcs}, {XLF} and ligase-4). A large repertoire of modular donor vectors renders {CRISPaint} compatible with a wide array of applications.},

	abstract = {Recombinant adeno-associated viruses ({rAAVs}) are promising vectors for gene therapy since they efficiently and stably transduce a variety of tissues of immunocompetent animals. The major disadvantage of {rAAVs} is their limited capacity to package foreign {DNA} ({\textless} or =5 kb). Often, co-expression of two or more genes from a single viral vector is desirable to achieve maximal therapeutic efficacy or to track transduced cells in vivo by suitable reporter genes. The internal ribosome entry site ({IRES}) sequence of encephalomyocarditis virus has been widely used to construct bicistronic viral vectors. However, the {IRES} is rather long and {IRES}-mediated translation can be relatively inefficient when compared with cap-dependent translation. As an alternative to the {IRES} for in vivo gene expression, we studied the 16 amino-acid long 2A peptide of foot and mouth disease virus ({FMDV}). The 2A peptide mediates the primary cis-'cleavage' of the {FMDV} polyprotein in a cascade of processing events that ultimately generate the mature {FMDV} proteins. We have generated several different {rAAV} genomes in which two coding regions are fused in-frame via the {FMDV} 2A sequence. We show that {FMDV} 2A efficiently mediates the generation of the expected cleavage products from the artificial fusion proteins in cells. Furthermore, we find that both {EGFP} and alpha- synuclein are expressed at substantially higher levels from 2A vectors than from the corresponding {IRES}-based vectors, while {SOD}-1 is expressed at comparable or slightly higher levels. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time, that the 2A sequence results in effective bicistronic gene expression in vivo after injection of 2A-dependent {rAAVs} into the rat substantia nigra. We conclude that 2A-containing {rAAVs} may represent an attractive alternative to {IRES}-dependent vectors for ex vivo and in vivo gene expression and gene therapy.},

The diverse mechanisms used by {IRESs} are reflected in their structural diversity, and this structural diversity challenges us to develop a cohesive model linking {IRES} function to structure.

	abstract = {Mitochondrial fidelity is tightly linked to overall cellular homeostasis and is compromised in ageing and various pathologies1–3. Mitochondrial malfunction needs to be relayed to the cytosol, where an integrated stress response is triggered by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α ({eIF}2α) in mammalian cells4,5. {eIF}2α phosphorylation is mediated by the four {eIF}2α kinases {GCN}2, {HRI}, {PERK} and {PKR}, which are activated by diverse types of cellular stress6. However, the machinery that communicates mitochondrial perturbation to the cytosol to trigger the integrated stress response remains unknown1,2,7. Here we combine genome engineering and haploid genetics to unbiasedly identify genes that affect the induction of C/{EBP} homologous protein ({CHOP}), a key factor in the integrated stress response. We show that the mitochondrial protease {OMA}1 and the poorly characterized protein {DELE}1, together with {HRI}, constitute the missing pathway that is triggered by mitochondrial stress. Mechanistically, stress-induced activation of {OMA}1 causes {DELE}1 to be cleaved into a short form that accumulates in the cytosol, where it binds to and activates {HRI} via its C-terminal portion. Obstruction of this pathway can be beneficial or adverse depending on the type of mitochondrial perturbation. In addition to the core pathway components, our comparative genetic screening strategy identifies a suite of additional regulators. Together, these findings could be used to inform future strategies to modulate the cellular response to mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of human disease.},
