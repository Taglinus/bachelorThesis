   abstract = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging and important human diseases. Mitochondrial defects disturb protein import and lead to cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial precursor proteins, disrupting cellular homeostasis. In human cells, this activates an integrated stress response to halt translation, and a heat shock response to counteract protein misfolding and aggregation. The interplay between these responses is critical for cellular fate in the face of mitochondrial perturbation.},

   abstract = {Stress response pathways detect and alleviate adverse conditions to safeguard cell and tissue homeostasis, yet their prolonged activation induces apoptosis and disrupts organismal health1–3. How stress responses are turned off at the right time and place remains poorly understood. Here we report a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism that silences the cellular response to mitochondrial protein import stress. Crucial to this process is the silencing factor of the integrated stress response (SIFI), a large E3 ligase complex mutated in ataxia and in early-onset dementia that degrades both unimported mitochondrial precursors and stress response components. By recognizing bifunctional substrate motifs that equally encode protein localization and stability, the SIFI complex turns off a general stress response after a specific stress event has been resolved. Pharmacological stress response silencing sustains cell survival even if stress resolution failed, which underscores the importance of signal termination and provides a roadmap for treating neurodegenerative diseases caused by mitochondrial import defects.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Designing PCR primers for amplifying regions of eukaryotic genomes is a complicated task because the genomes contain a large number of repeat sequences and other regions unsuitable for amplification by PCR. We have developed a novel k-mer based masking method that uses a statistical model to detect and mask failure-prone regions on the DNA template prior to primer design. We implemented the software as a standalone software primer3_masker and integrated it into the primer design program Primer3. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The standalone version of primer3_masker is implemented in C. The source code is freely available at https://github.com/bioinfo-ut/primer3_masker/ (standalone version for Linux and macOS) and at https://github.com/primer3-org/primer3/ (integrated version). Primer3 web application that allows masking sequences of 196 animal and plant genomes is available at http://primer3.ut.ee/. CONTACT: maido.remm@ut.ee. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

   abstract = {The determination of annealing temperature is a critical step in PCR design. This parameter is typically derived from the melting temperature of the PCR primers, so for successful PCR work it is important to determine the melting temperature of primer accurately. We introduced several enhancements in the widely used primer design program Primer3. The improvements include a formula for calculating melting temperature and a salt correction formula. Also, the new version can take into account the effects of divalent cations, which are included in most PCR buffers. Another modification enables using lowercase masked template sequences for primer design. AVAILABILITY: Features described in this article have been implemented into the development code of Primer3 and will be available in future versions (version 1.1 and newer) of Primer3. Also, a modified version is compiled under the name of mPrimer3 which is distributed independently. The web-based version of mPrimer3 is available at http://bioinfo.ebc.ee/mprimer3/ and the binary code is freely downloadable from the URL http://bioinfo.ebc.ee/download/.},

   abstract = {Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a basic molecular biology technique with a multiplicity of uses, including deoxyribonucleic acid cloning and sequencing, functional analysis of genes, diagnosis of diseases, genotyping and discovery of genetic variants. Reliable primer design is crucial for successful PCR, and for over a decade, the open-source Primer3 software has been widely used for primer design, often in high-throughput genomics applications. It has also been incorporated into numerous publicly available software packages and web services. During this period, we have greatly expanded Primer3's functionality. In this article, we describe Primer3's current capabilities, emphasizing recent improvements. The most notable enhancements incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer design process, both to improve melting temperature prediction and to reduce the likelihood that primers will form hairpins or dimers. Additional enhancements include more precise control of primer placement-a change motivated partly by opportunities to use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair. We have made the core code more modular and provided cleaner programming interfaces to further ease integration with other software. These improvements position Primer3 for continued use with genome-scale data in the decade ahead.},

   abstract = {Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) belongs to the activating transcription factor family and its expression is increased upon the stimulation of a diverse array of microenvironmental stresses. ATF4 plays a major role in the development, metabolism, and memory formation. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease in aged population. The dominant pathological changes in AD brain, including the neurofibrillary tangles, consist of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, senile plaques composed of β-amyloid proteins, loss of neurons in the whole brain, and dysfunction of synapses. The protein level of ATF4 is upregulated in both AD brain and AD mouse model, indicating its latent roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. In this paper, we reviewed the related literatures about the interaction of ATF4 with the different types of pathological changes in AD brain and pointed out some unsolved problems in this area. We also proposed that a fine regulation of ATF4 in separate neurons or brain regions might be benefit to the therapy of AD.},
